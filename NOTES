About Node JS:

JavaScript is something that we

could really only run in the browser and they allowed it to run as a stand alone process on your machine.

So before Noad, JavaScript just could not be used as a more general purpose programming language,

it was limited to what the browser allowed it to do.

So, for example, I could use JavaScript to add a click event to this button or to redirect a user

to a different page.

But there was no way to use the JavaScript programming language outside of the browser to build things

like Web servers that could access the file system and connect to databases.

All of these are things that other programming languages can do without any problem.

All of this ended up changing with the introduction of node JS. With node JS,

JavaScript developers could now use JavaScript on the server side so they could use the same JavaScript

programming language to create Web servers, command line interfaces, application back ends and more,

all of which will end up covering in the class.

So at a high level, you know what node is node as a way to run JavaScript code on the server as opposed

to being forced to run it on the client in the browser?
